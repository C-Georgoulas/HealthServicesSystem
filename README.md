# Health Services System

Access the application on [Heroku](https://clinicservicesystem.herokuapp.com/ "Heroku") and login with the following credentials for full access:

Username: admin@gmail.com
Password: 123

This application was made with the MERN stack, as well as using passport.js for authentication and various roles. This was made for my bachelor's thesis within Harokopio University of Athens, Computer Science & Telematics.

Here are a list of features below:

- Permissions & Role based access within the application.
- Administration system with User Creation / Edit, adding new pharmaceutical drugs to the system, as well as making new trainees.
- Trainee system where there are trainee student files with general information, average grade that comes through the note/grade report system for instructors.
- Patient list with easy filtering (Department Patients / My Patients / Active or Inactive Patients etcetera).
- Specific patient cards with general information, surgery list and details for each surgery, note system.
- Prescription system with expiration dates, easy filtration methods, dosage calculation based on patient age and suggested dosages.
- Search methods that make access easy.
- Pharmaceutical drug information through a list of all pharmaceuticals available.
- Easy notification / redirect system.

To conclude and sum it up, this enables a clinic to become fully operational. Here's my abstract from my thesis, in regards to why I decided to make something like this:

In today's age, public hospitals and clinics in Greece do not have the necessary budget and funding, which leaves them with outdated systems, in terms of managing patients and inter-hospital general operations. It is also worth noting that most employees within public hospitals prefer handwritten paperwork as it is faster than the outdated applications and systems that are available to them. Those systems, also, do not have a lot of functionalities that can help them in their day-to-day tasks, other than creating a prescription and a few other small functionalities that are redundant.

The purpose of the Automated Health Services System is the improvement of hospital / clinic operations. The biggest advantage is that a desktop isn't the only machine able to access the system, as the web application is also accessible through a phone, which everyone has in today's modern age. That makes the system available to almost anyone who works in the hospital and has an active role, which enables users to review patient records, files or pending scheduled surgeries in a very small amount of time without requiring to review any physical paperwork.

By using the system, the calculation of dosage, notifications for specific operations (e.g surgeries), information in regards to every pharmaceutical drug available, patient card details are automated processes which are gathered in one system. This results in reducing the amount of physical paperwork based bureaucracy that employees spend on, with the main goal of serving the people who are in need in a faster and better way.

It should be now known that the point of the system is the improvement of hospital operations, with the goal of bettering the quality of medical treatments of patients without any unnecessary delays which may put the work of preservation of life at risk.
